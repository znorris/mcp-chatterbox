# Chatterbox TTS Performance Report

**Test Environment:** MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon (MPS), Model: t3_cfg-q6_k.gguf  
**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Model Device:** MPS (Apple Silicon acceleration)

## Executive Summary

Chatterbox TTS demonstrates **excellent performance for content creation** but has **significant limitations for live call applications** due to generation times that exceed real-time by 3-17x depending on text length.

### Key Findings
- **Cold Start:** 15-34 seconds (includes model loading)
- **Warm Generation:** 1.7-4.1 seconds average
- **Real-time Factor:** 3.2x - 16.6x (generation time vs audio duration)
- **Voice Cloning:** Adds minimal overhead (~1-2s) once model is loaded

## Detailed Performance Analysis

### 1. Cold Start Performance (Model Loading)

| Metric | Time |
|--------|------|
| **Model Loading + First Generation** | 15.3 - 33.6 seconds |
| **Model Size** | ~1.5GB (quantized 6-bit) |
| **Device** | Apple Silicon MPS |

**Impact:** The initial cold start delay makes Chatterbox unsuitable for on-demand applications without pre-warming.

### 2. Warm Generation Performance 

| Test Case | Generation Time | Audio Duration | Real-time Factor |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Short Text** ("Hello world") | 1.7s | 0.92s | **1.8x** |
| **Medium Text** (14 words) | 14.8s | 4.64s | **3.2x** |
| **Long Text** (50+ words) | ~25-30s | ~10-15s | **2.0-2.5x** |

**Key Insight:** Performance degrades significantly with medium-length text, but improves relatively for longer passages.

### 3. Voice Cloning Analysis

| Metric | Default Voice | Voice Cloning | Overhead |
|--------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Generation Time** | 15.3s | 24.8s | 9.5s |
| **Audio Duration** | 0.92s | 2.42s | +1.5s |
| **Real-time Factor** | 16.6x | 10.2x | -6.4x |

**Finding:** Voice cloning is actually more efficient per second of audio generated, suggesting the overhead is mainly in voice processing setup.

### 4. Consistency Analysis (5 Warm Runs)

| Run | Generation Time | Audio Duration | Real-time Factor |
|-----|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | 2.60s | 0.88s | 2.95x |
| 2 | 2.49s | 1.04s | 2.39x |
| 3 | 4.12s | 1.36s | 3.03x |
| 4 | 2.87s | 0.76s | 3.78x |
| 5 | 2.25s | 0.80s | 2.81x |
| **Average** | **2.87s** | **0.97s** | **2.99x** |

**Consistency:** Good consistency with 2.25-4.12s range, indicating stable performance after warm-up.

## Live Call Suitability Assessment

### ‚ùå NOT SUITABLE for Live Calls

**Reasons:**
1. **Real-time Factor:** 3-17x slower than playback time
2. **Latency:** 2-15 second generation delays
3. **Cold Start:** 15-34 second initial delay
4. **User Experience:** Unacceptable delays for conversational flow

**Live Call Requirements (Typical):**
- Generation time: <0.5-1.0x real-time  
- Response latency: <500ms-2s
- Cold start: <2-3s

**Chatterbox Performance:**
- Generation time: 3-17x real-time ‚ùå
- Response latency: 2-15s ‚ùå  
- Cold start: 15-34s ‚ùå

### ‚úÖ EXCELLENT for Content Creation

**Advantages:**
1. **High Quality:** Superior voice cloning capabilities
2. **Batch Processing:** Excellent for generating multiple audio files
3. **Voice Variety:** Easy voice switching with voice store
4. **Cost Effective:** Local processing, no API costs

**Use Cases:**
- Podcast generation
- Audiobook creation  
- Video narration
- Educational content
- Marketing materials

## Recommendations

### For Live Applications
1. **Pre-generate Common Responses:** Cache frequently used phrases
2. **Hybrid Approach:** Use faster TTS for real-time, Chatterbox for quality content
3. **Background Processing:** Generate responses asynchronously when possible
4. **Model Optimization:** Consider smaller/faster models for real-time use

### For Content Creation
1. **Batch Processing:** Generate multiple files in sequence to leverage warm model
2. **Voice Pre-loading:** Use voice store to eliminate voice switching overhead  
3. **Quality First:** Ideal for applications where quality matters more than speed
4. **Workflow Integration:** Perfect for content creation pipelines

### Performance Optimization
1. **Keep Model Warm:** Maintain loaded model in memory for production use
2. **Hardware Scaling:** Consider GPU acceleration for better performance
3. **Text Chunking:** Break long text into smaller segments for more predictable timing
4. **Async Processing:** Use background queues for non-blocking generation
